# Self-Driving Car (Neural Network)

I reached a phase where I wanted to learn more about AI and machine learning. This was back before ChatGPT and LLMs, so I turned to machine learning. After realizing I had no clue about half the math, especially when it crossed into the 4th dimension. So I finally found this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkI9ia2cLhc&list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY). It all kind of clicked. It's not that I fully understood neural networking, but I was past using libraries and had some sort of idea on how it worked. Other than that, this project is not super interesting, but it did teach me a ton of JavaScript tips that inspired [Crown.JS](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/)
